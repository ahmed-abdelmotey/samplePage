# samplePage
this is a sample responsive mobile friendly webpage 

- the majority of design elements was achieved with pure css including css shapes, gradients, etc... 
- the used images are icons and background images only

- fun fact: I was so lazy searching for a  good video, so I used a video of me pitching for an idea :D, hope you like it.

> if you are a developer, see the console for more info.

> for IE and Edge clip-path doesn't work so maybe providing polyfills later
